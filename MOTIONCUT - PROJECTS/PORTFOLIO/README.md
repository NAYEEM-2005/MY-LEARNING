 Breakdown of HTML and CSS

 1. General Styles

- Body: The body element has a dark background color, and text color for the entire body. The font used is 'Verdana', providing a clean, modern look.

 2. Header Styles

- The header features a linear gradient background with a shadow effect for depth. Navigation links are styled for a smooth color transition on hover, enhancing user experience.

 3. Section Styles

- Each section has distinct background colors and padding to create separation:

  - Home Section: Uses a radial gradient for visual interest.

  - About Section: Centers content with flexbox and includes hover effects on images.

  - Projects Section: Utilizes CSS Grid for responsive project displays with hover effects on project items.

  - Skills Section: Features a honeycomb layout to present skills attractively.

 4. Achievements Section

- Styled lists with hover effects enhance interactivity, making the achievements more engaging.

 5. Resume and Contact Sections, Social icons

- The resume section includes a button for downloading the resume, while the contact form uses flexbox to center inputs and buttons, ensuring usability on all devices.

6. Responsive Design 

- Media queries adjust layouts for various screen sizes:

  - Up to 768px: Adjusts header layout to vertical, modifies project grid for better display on smaller screens, and stacks about content.

  - Up to 480px: Further reduces font sizes and padding for mobile optimization.
